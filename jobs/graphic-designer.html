	<h1>Graphic Designer (Junior and Senior)</h1>
	<div class="jobs-section">
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Siku-Siku started as a web user interface development company. We design websites, build custom interfaces (e.g. web form inputs / controls), code newsletters, and customize content management system (CMS) themes. All of these with the main focus on accessibility, usability, and user experience. So, our user-friendly deliverables are &mdash; and must be &mdash; compatible across all targeted browsers (and email clients, in case of newsletter); with the main goal of providing the best possible user experience. We are also steadily moving into the mobile world, where accessibility, usability, and user experience are as important as, if not more than, on the web. In terms of the team, we are a small group of HTML/CSS/JavaScript experts, graphic designers, and user interface / experience (UI/UX) designers. Our clients are startup companies in the Bay Area, California.</p>
		<p>We are currently looking to add a UI Developer to join our new team in Jakarta (we consciously keep our team small). This is a specialized position that requires a full depth understanding of any related front-end web engineering. It’ll be a great exposure to work directly with some Silicon Valley startups.</p>
